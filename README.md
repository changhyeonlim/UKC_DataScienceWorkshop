# UKC_DataScienceWorkshop
Hello! This repository is to backup shared codes @ UKC Data science workshop. I was one of the workshop organizers and instructor. We hold this conference yearly, and it's a great place to meet and network people from not just in engineering but also in medical, academics, and research fields. We've got an increasing number of participants for this workshop every year. If you are interested in participating or in helping out, feel free to contact me.
